Sadly, these are incomplete. Some logs are present only in commit nessages. Some were lost entirely. Where possible, logs are first committed in the same commit as the change they helped author.

Also a fair amount if the vibe-coding done was with bots like Google's Jules or OpenAI's Codex, which don't make it easy to copy their logs, but leave other traces in the repo.
