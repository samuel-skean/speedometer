## User (checkpoint)

Make the font size of all the things in the bottom bar consistent. Basically, average the two sizes currently there.

**Analyzing Font Consistency**

I'm currently focused on the `index.html` file. My goal is to pinpoint the elements within the speedometer's bottom bar and, crucially, determine their respective font sizes. I anticipate needing this information to calculate an average font size for uniformity.


**Defining Measurement Parameters**

I've determined the elements within the bottom bar. Now, I'm analyzing the CSS associated with those elements. Specifically, I am searching the CSS for font-size declarations. My next step will be to extract the values to use for the average font size.



</thinking>

Okay, user wants to average the two font sizes in the bottom bar. I'll start by inspecting `index.html` to identify the elements and their current font sizes.

**Examining Bottom Bar Consistency**

I'm focused on the bottom bar, specifically ensuring uniform font sizes. My main targets are `#status` and any elements within `.bottom-left-controls`. I'm going through the CSS to identify and potentially override any size discrepancies. I've also identified a placeholder div, which needs to be considered as well.


**Calculating Font Size Adjustments**

Okay, I've calculated the average font size. I'll adjust the current sizes for consistency, aiming for 18px across the bottom bar elements. Now, I'm ready to use the `replace` tool to modify the CSS in `index.html`. My first target is the `.status` font size.



</thinking>

Okay, I need to standardize the font sizes in the bottom bar. The two relevant classes, `.status` and `.bottom-left-controls`, have font sizes of 20px and 16px, respectively. Averaging these gives me 18px. I'll use the `replace` tool to update both font sizes to `18px` in `index.html`, starting with `.status`.

**Altering Font Sizes**

\n\n

I've decided to adjust the font size for the `.bottom-left-controls`. I'm going to experiment to find the optimal size to improve readability and visual balance within the design. Considering a few different options before finalizing.



</thinking>

Okay, time to change the `.bottom-left-controls` font size.
